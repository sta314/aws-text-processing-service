# LLM Text Processing Service Working Fully on AWS
### CS683 Cloud Computing Project

This project is about a text processing service that utilizes LLMs that can support both text inputs or multiple files (text, image) to be processed. You can see the architecture we designed and example photos from the UI. Unfortunately, CloudFormation template is not available, however you may benefit from the overall architecture.
